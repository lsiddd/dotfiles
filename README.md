# dotfiles

## Dotfiles for:

* i3-gaps
* bash
* alacritty
* zsh
* vim


## vim 

For the .vimrc to work properly, you're expexted to use a plugin manager, such as vundle. If you prefer another manager, please update the plugin section in the file to get it working properly. To install vundle just execute :

```
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

## Instalation

In fedora-like systems, just executing the install script should be enough.

## For other distros, the following dependencies should be installed:

* i3-gaps
* i3blocks
* rofi
* zsh
* conky
* dmenu
* NetworkManager/network-manager-applet (name could vary depending on distro)
* alacritty
* vim 
* compton
